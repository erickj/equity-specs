      NOTE(erick): I had trouble setting up the initial Wildfly deployment, it
      turns out Wildfly has a dependency on a Weld (CDI implementation) version
      where using 'javax.inject.*' annotations causes class loader issues.

      For details see: http://weld.cdi-spec.org/documentation/#4

      "My application bundles a third-party library which uses javax.inject
      annotations. This library was not intended to be a CDI library but on CDI 1.1
      this library is being picked up as an implicit bean archive and breaks the
      deployment of my application. Why is this happening?

      Firstly, this issue only affects CDI 1.1. If possible, go and upgrade to CDI 1.2
      (Weld 2.2 or later) where this issue does not occur.

      If you cannot do that, read further: This is a known issue in the CDI 1.1
      specification and occurs with third-party libraries such as Guava.

      ...

      per-deployment configuration - add the following content to
      META-INF/jboss-all.xml of the application"
